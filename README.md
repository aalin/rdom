## Description

This is a basic experiment with a server side VDOM in Ruby.
For a more complete implementation, see
[Mayu Live](https://github.com/mayu-live/framework).
I had some ideas that I felt like I had to explore,
and this is the result.

## Getting started

Make sure you have
[Ruby 3.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/),
then run:

    bundle install

To start the server:

    ruby config.ru

## Server

This thing comes with an HTTP/2 server.
Start it with `ruby config.ru`.

By default it binds to `https://localhost:8080`,
but it can be changed by setting the environment variable
`RDOM_BIND` like this `RDOM_BIND="https://[::]" ruby config.ru`.

## Embedding

These are the only lines of HTML you need to mount an app.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://rdom.fly.dev/rdom.js"></script>
<rdom-embed src="https://rdom.fly.dev/.rdom"></rdom-embed>
```

## Transforms

You can use `bin/transform` to see the transformed output of a Haml-file.

Example:

    bin/transform app/List.haml

## Limitations

### Only streaming

Apps made with this can only be streamed, the server will never
attempt to construct the HTML for the initial request.
If you need to serve HTML in the initial request, have a look at
[Mayu Live](https://github.com/mayu-live/framework).

### No resuming

If the connection drops, all state is lost.
For an attempt at something more reliable, check out
[Mayu Live](https://github.com/mayu-live/framework).

### Fragments don't work etc

All static DOM trees are extracted into custom elements, so if you write:

```haml
- items = %w[foo bar baz]
%ul
  = items.map do |item|
    %li= item
```

Then this code will be generated:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true
class self::Component < VDOM::Component::Base
  RDOM_Partials = [
    VDOM::CustomElement[
      :"rdom-elem-appêž‰êž‰my-component.haml-0",
      '<ul><slot id="slot0"></slot></ul>'
    ],
    VDOM::CustomElement[
      :"rdom-elem-appêž‰êž‰my-component.haml-1",
      '<li><slot id="slot0"></slot></li>'
    ]
  ]
  def render
    items = %w[foo bar baz]
    H[
      RDOM_Partials[0],
      slots: {
        slot0: items.map { |item| H[RDOM_Partials[1], slots: { slot0: item }] }
      }
    ]
  end
end
```

The browser will give you:

```html
<rdom-elem-my-component.haml-0>
  #shadow-dom
    <ul><slot></slot></ul>
    <li>
      <slot id="slot0">
        <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1> â†´
        <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1> â†´
        <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1> â†´
      </slot>
    </li>
  <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
    #shadow-dom
      <li>
        <slot id="slot0">
          <#text> â†´
        </slot>
      </li>
    foo
  </rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
  <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
    #shadow-dom
      <li>
        <slot id="slot0">
          <#text> â†´
        </slot>
      </li>
    bar
  </rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
  <rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
    #shadow-dom
      <li>
        <slot id="slot0">
          <#text> â†´
        </slot>
      </li>
    baz
  </rdom-elem-my-component.haml-1>
</rdom-elem-my-component.haml-0>
```

Each slot inside the shadow DOM will have it's
nodes assigned whenever children are updated.

This is good for several reasons:

* Markup is only transferred to the browser once and can be reused.
* Diffing becomes easier because we don't have care about order.
  [HTMLSlotElement.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSlotElement/assign)
  updates the order of children in 1 call.
  Most VDOM libraries use the use the famous 2-way-diffing algorithm,
  which is difficult to get right.

However, it makes some things trickier:

* Custom elements are created during compile time and hence not visible
  to the developer, which can cause wrapping issues with `flex` and `grid`
  which work on the immediate child, which would be the generated custom
  element, and not the element that the developer expected, which would
  be the first child of the custom element.
* Stylesheets are scoped to each custom element, so class names don't work
  even inside the same component.
  Class names are very convenient and everyone knows how they work.
  [Shadow parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part)
  can be exported so that stylesheets in parent shadow DOMs can access them,
  but they don't work 100% the same which might be confusing.
  Trying to think of a way to transform class names into parts, or if class
  names would work fine, as long as the same stylesheet is inserted into the
  shadow DOMs of each custom element in that component.
  Nesting wouldn't work usually because it would be across components.

I think it would be possible to generate fewer custom elements,
because [some elements allow you to attach a shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow#elements_you_can_attach_a_shadow_to).
In other cases, we could detect if the outer element is one of those,
and create a custom element based on that element.
